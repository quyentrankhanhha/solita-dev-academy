## SOLITA DEV ACADEMY 2022 EXERCISE

## Description of the project

This project displays data (farm name, date, period, sensor type and location which I randomly choose to show on map) from different farms. This is the Frontend version of the project.

## Technology
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/ReactJs-17.0.2-blue) ![MUI](https://img.shields.io/badge/MUI-5.2.5-9cf) ![axios](https://img.shields.io/badge/axios-0.24.0-red) ![Highcharts](https://img.shields.io/badge/Highcharts-9.3.2-blueviolet) ![Leaflet](https://img.shields.io/badge/Leaflet-1.7.1-brightgreen) ![uuid](https://img.shields.io/badge/uuid-8.3.2-red)
The reasons to choose: 
- ReactJS framework: Developement efficiency- Less development time and higher quality ans specially, strong support community 
- MUI (Material UI)
- Highcharts is chosen because it has plenty of chart types, looks good in any screen resolutions or size, works well on all modern browsers such as Chrome, Mozilla, Internet Explorer, Netscape, and Safari, and is supported with custom theming.
- Leaflet with an open-source Javascript library and the easy to understand and use API is a good choice to create the map. 
- uuid to create the random id
